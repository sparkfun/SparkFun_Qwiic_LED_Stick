  Qwiic LED Stick is an I2C based LED Stick that stores an array of colors and brightness to write to an LED strip
  The Qwiic LED Stick features ten addressable APA102 LEDs, making it easy to add full color LED control using I2C.
  Write to individual LEDs to display a count in binary, or write to the whole strip for cool lighting effects.

  To install support for ATtiny85 in Arduino IDE: https://github.com/SpenceKonde/ATTinyCore/blob/master/Installation.md
  This core is installed from the Board Manager menu
  This core has built in support for I2C S/M and serial
  If you have Dave Mellis' ATtiny installed you may need to remove it from \Users\xx\AppData\Local\Arduino15\Packages

  To support 400kHz I2C communication reliably ATtiny85 needs to run at 8MHz. This requires user to
  click on 'Burn Bootloader' before code is loaded.
